# Vue | Inertia.js | Laravel | TailwindCSS

This package is an Inertia.js table built with Laravel, Vue, and TailwindCSS. The design and code structure is highly inspired by FilamentPHP's table.

## Setup
You can watch any YouTube tutorial or read articles to set up your Laravel project to work with Inertia.js and Vue. For beginners, you can follow this [guide](https://inertiajs.com/server-side-setup) to set up your server-side (Laravel) and this [guide](https://inertiajs.com/client-side-setup) for the client-side (Vue). Additionally, if you don't want to manually set up your server and client-side, you can use Laravel starter kits like Breeze or Jetstream, as explained in this [guide](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/frontend#inertia-starter-kits). This package uses Tailwind CSS, so you also need to set it up using this [guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/laravel).

## Installation
You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require jaocero/vilt-table
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
